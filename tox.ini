# Automated testing.
# https://tox.wiki/en/latest/config.html

# NOTE: Since we don't use clean and --cov-append, the tests coverage is from the 
# last python env that is run. Shouldn't be a problem though since we expect similar
# coverage from all python env (we don't branch much on python version).

# NOTE: The coverage report doesn't include the files in the scons/ directory
# which are run in a subprocess. This includes python files such as
# scons_util.py and the SConstruct files.

# Useful commands
# 
# Run everything:
#  tox 
#
# Lint only:
#  tox -e lint 
#
# Test only (in decreasing scope size)
#  tox --skip-env lint
#  tox -e py313
#  tox -e py313 -- test/commands
#  tox -e py313 -- test/commands/test_examples.py
#  tox -e py313 -- test/commands/test_examples.py::test_examples
#

# Installing python interpreters
# Mac:   brew install python@3.10
# Win:   ???
# Linux: ???
