# Using SystemVerilog

You can use SystemVerilog files in your Apio project just like Verilog files. Simply change the file extension from `.v` to `.sv` to indicate that they should be handled as SystemVerilog files. This applies to both synthesizable modules and testbenches.

> It's also okay to mix Verilog `.v` files and SystemVerilog `.sv` files within the same project.
