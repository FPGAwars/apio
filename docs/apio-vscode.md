# Using Apio with VSCode

Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is a popular, flexible, and free IDE
that support many languages and has an active eco-system. This page provides
tips for using Apio with VScode.

## Install the Apio FPGA extension

The Apio team provides an official extension called `Apio FPGA` that facilitate using apio 
with VSCode by providing a single click access to apio commands such as
`built`, `test`, `sim` and `upload`. The extension is triggered automatically
when a folder that contains `apio.ini` is opened using the `File | Open Folder ...`
VSCode command.

For more information about the extension see its [README.md file ](https://github.com/FPGAwars/apio-vscode?tab=readme-ov-file#apio-fpga-for-vs-code).
