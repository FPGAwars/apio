## NOTES

- Devices like the FTDI FT2232 with multiple channels may appear as
  multiple entriesâ€”one per serial port.

- On Windows, manufacturer and product strings of FTDI based devices may
  show their FTDI generic values rather than the custom values such as 'Alhambra II' set by the device manufacturer.
