# Contributing boards definitions

Once you tested your custom boards, FPGAs, and programmers definitions
as describe in the [Custom Boards](custom-boards.md) page, you can contribute
them to the Apio project so they can benefit other users as well.

> When contributing a new board definition, it's is highly recommended to
> contribute also and example for that board. Please wait for the new board
> definitions to be released before contributing examples for that board.

Apio definitions are stored in the Apio `definitions` repository at [https://github.com/FPGAwars/apio-definitions ](https://github.com/FPGAwars/apio-definitions). Simply submit a pull request with the modified files.

> Note that your contribution will be available to users only after Apio
> will be configured remotely to use the new version of the `definitions`
> package. The Apio remote configuration are served from [https://github.com/FPGAwars/apio/tree/main/remote-config](https://github.com/FPGAwars/apio/tree/main/remote-config)
