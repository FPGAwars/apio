# Apio Video Tutorial

[Shawn Hymel](https://shawnhymel.com/) created an excellent video series introducing FPGA design using Apio 0.6.5. To view the series on YouTube, click the video thumbnail below.

> The Apio 0.6.5 commands used in the video series differ slightly from the enhanced set of Apio 1.x.x commands. For details, see the [Apio 1.x.x command differences](migrating-from-apio-0.9.5.md#know-the-new-commands) between Apio 0.x and 1.x.
