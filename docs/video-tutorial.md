# Apio Video Tutorial

[Shawn Hymel](https://shawnhymel.com/) created an excellent video series introducing FPGA design using Apio 0.95. To view the series on YouTube, click the video thumbnail below.

> The Apio 0.6.5 commands used in the video series differ from the current Apio 1.x.x commands, but all their functionality has been preservedâ€”and even improved. For details, see the [Apio 1.x.x command differences](migrating-from-apio-0xx.md#know-the-new-commands).
