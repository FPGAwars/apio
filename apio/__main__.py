Work with FPGAs with ease.

Apio is a user friendly command-line
suite that supports all the aspect of FPGA firmware developement
from linting, building and simulating to unit testing, to progreamming
the FPGA board.

Apio commands are typically invoked in the root directory of the FPGA
project where the project configuration file apio.ini and the project
source files are stored. For help on specific commands use the -h
flag (e.g. 'apio build -h').
